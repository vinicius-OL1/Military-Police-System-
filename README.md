## Description
The program relies on the use of a few TXT files that will act as a
database. In this way, it is essential to properly read the files. Or
The first TXT file is that of vehicles (patrol cars.txt), which will contain data from all
available vehicles, each with an identifier and the type of vehicle, which
will be important for the operation of the "Vehicle Login" function.
The second input file, people.txt, encompasses a series of (fictional) people
used in the "Search by CPF". The file contains: name, social security number, city
police records and defaults of each individual (if any - a number
followed by the names of the delinquencies). Lastly, the police file.txt
who owns the police corps, composed of the name, CPF, nom de guerre, city,
age, job title, and your encrypted password.
